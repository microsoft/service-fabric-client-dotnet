## Getting Started

### Prerequesites
Each project is a normal C# Visual Studio 2017 project. At minimum, you need [MSBuild 15](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/msbuild/what-s-new-in-msbuild-15-0), [PowerShell](https://msdn.microsoft.com/powershell/mt173057.aspx), [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows) and [.NET Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48130) to build and generate NuGet packages.

We recommend installing [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/) which will set you up with all the .NET build tools and allow you to open the solution files. Community Edition is free and can be used to build everything here.

### Build
To build everything and generate NuGet packages, run the **build.ps1** script. NuGet packages and PowerShell module will be dropped in a *drop* directory at the repo root.

Each project can also be built individually directly through Visual Studio or by running the solution file through MSBuild.

For branches, please see [Branching Information](CONTRIBUTING.md#BranchingInformation)
